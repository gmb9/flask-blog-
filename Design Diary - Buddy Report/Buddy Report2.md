We met a second time on February 11th, and continued working on our projects together. Peter finished the assignment and was mostly working towards his stretch goal of making his website have an overall more polished look as well as helping me finish up my own project. Noah was still having some trouble with figuring out exactly what he had to do, so in the first part of our meeting both Peter and I helped Noah to figure out his project by remaking his repository and cloning your repository to get him more on track.

Overall, Noah seemed like due to his lack of overall progression in classes he was having trouble with a lot of the basics that Peter and I were able to overlook. Noah seemed like he was excited to learn about Python and work on the project, but was just held back by his past experience with computer science.

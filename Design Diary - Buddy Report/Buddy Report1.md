We met on Tuesday February 4th for the first time as an initial checkup to see how everybody was doing early on into the project. Peter had done a lot of work and helped me to get my login and all page working from the point I had gotten on my own. Noah was a little bit stuck, and was mostly working to wrap his head around how to actually get his project working.

We also worked on fixing up our github pages, making sure that we all had it setup correctly and ready to turn in when the time came.

Peter was definitely the most 'fluent' when it came to the project, and it seemed like he really knew what he was doing. Noah was a little bit behind and was focused mostly on just trying to figure out how to get started using lab machines/rented laptops. I learned the most with the help of Peter, as he could easily explain what he was doing.
